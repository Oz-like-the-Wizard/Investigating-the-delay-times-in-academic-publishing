# Investigating the delay times in academic publishing 
## NOVA IMS University - Data Science and Advanced Analytics MSc - Dissertation

The aim of this study is to analyze the differences in article publishing delay times from different
perspectives. Previous works on the topic suggest there are significant differences between article
publication times, which has a direct effect on the authorâ€™s personal and professional life. However, as
the required dates for the analysis are not available in article databases, the works on the topic are
limited to certain publishers/databases.
