# Thesis-Project---Publishing-Delay-in-Scholarly-Journals

This repository includes all the necessary codes used so far in my thesis project aiming to analyze the reasons behind the publishing lag time between an article's submission to a scholarly journal to its publication.

As this is a work in progress, the repository  & notebooks are not in their final form.

However, to get a general understanding of the project, you can check notebooks from parts 4-5-6.
